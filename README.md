# Guessing Game

Welcome to the Guessing Game! This project marks my initial foray into the Rust programming language. Through this game, I'm exploring and testing my understanding of Rust's fundamentals.

## Project Overview

The Guessing Game is a simple interactive application where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. It's designed to help me learn and apply Rust concepts such as:

- Variable handling
- User input and output
- Control flow (loops and conditionals)
- Error handling
- Random number generation

## Features

- **User Input:** The game accepts user guesses via the command line.
- **Random Number Generation:** A random number is generated at the start of each game session.
- **Feedback System:** The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- **Error Handling:** Proper handling of invalid inputs.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you need to have Rust installed. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/guessing-game.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd guessing-game
    ```

3. Compile and run the game:
    ```sh
    cargo run
    ```

## Learning Goals

By working on this project, I aim to achieve the following:

- Gain familiarity with Rust syntax and semantics.
- Understand basic Rust programming concepts and paradigms.
- Develop problem-solving skills in a new programming language.

## Acknowledgements

This project is inspired by the examples provided in "The Rust Programming Language" book, which is an excellent resource for anyone looking to learn Rust.
